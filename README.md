## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it. In this Gitpod example, `hugo -D` has been run already which shows you the final build of the static site - feel free to delete the `public` folder once you get started. 

### An existing project

To get started with Hugo on Gitpod, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.
